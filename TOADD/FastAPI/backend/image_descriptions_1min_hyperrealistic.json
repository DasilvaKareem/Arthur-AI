  "Hyperrealistic wide shot of a detective's office. Dust motes dance in the beam of a single, warm desk lamp illuminating JENNY, seated at a heavily cluttered desk. Rain visibly streaks down a window showing an overcast city scene. Focus on the texture of old paper, wood grain, and wet glass.",
  "Hyperrealistic extreme close-up of an aged, slightly yellowed letter. The paper texture is highly detailed, showing fibers. A cryptic message in faded black ink is legible. Jenny's fingers, showing realistic skin texture and faint smudges, grip the edges.",
  "Hyperrealistic close-up on Jenny's face. Individual strands of hair are visible, realistic skin pores and subtle expression lines around her eyes and mouth. The dim office light reflects in her irises. Her expression conveys intense concentration and suspicion.",
  "Hyperrealistic wide shot of an abandoned gothic mansion. Focus on extreme detail: peeling paint, missing shingles, individual leaves on overgrown ivy, weathered stone textures. JENNY is a small figure standing before the main entrance, looking determined under a dramatic, partly cloudy sky.",
  "Hyperrealistic medium shot of Jenny in front of the mansion entrance. Her trench coat shows realistic fabric texture and slight dampness. Her expression is resolute. The background shows the decaying facade in sharp detail. A light breeze subtly moves strands of her hair.",
  "Hyperrealistic low-angle tracking shot focusing on Jenny's worn leather boots climbing crumbling stone steps. Detail on the weathered, cracked stone, moss growth in crevices, and realistic dust kicked up with each step. Her trench coat hem is visible.",
  "Hyperrealistic point-of-view shot entering a dark, hidden room. Thick dust particles float visibly in beams of flickering candlelight. Cobwebs with intricate strands hang from ceiling corners. Dusty, leather-bound books and mysterious artifacts are barely visible on shelves.",
  "Hyperrealistic close-up of Jenny's hands searching through an ancient book. Detail on the brittle, yellowed paper texture, faded ink, and the realistic grime and dust coating her fingers and the book's cover. Flickering candlelight provides illumination.",
  "Hyperrealistic medium shot, pulling back slightly. Jenny holds up a small, ornate brass key. The key's intricate details and metallic surface gleam realistically in the flickering candlelight. Dust motes swirl around her. Her expression is triumphant but thoughtful.",
  "Hyperrealistic wide shot of the mansion exterior at night under a full moon. Moonlight creates stark, elongated shadows. JENNY stands facing a tall, silhouetted MYSTERIOUS FIGURE near the main entrance. Ground fog clings realistically to the overgrown lawn.",
  "Hyperrealistic over-the-shoulder shot from behind JENNY. Her shoulder and the back of her head are in the foreground. The MYSTERIOUS FIGURE stands further off, largely in shadow, face obscured. Moonlight highlights the texture of their dark clothing. Focus is sharp on the figure.",
  "Hyperrealistic close-up, zooming in slightly on the MYSTERIOUS FIGURE's face, partially illuminated by moonlight. Focus on realistic skin texture, the subtle muscle movement forming a sly smile, and the cold glint of reflected moonlight in their eyes. The background is softly blurred."
